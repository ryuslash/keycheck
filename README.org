* Keycheck

  Until I come up with a better name.

  Quickly check to see if a keyring is locked or unlocked.

** Requirements

   Keycheck requires both Vala and libsecret be installed and requires
   Gnome Keyring Daemon is running.

** Usage

   To check if the default keyring is locked or unlocked call keycheck
   without any arguments:

   : keycheck

   To check whether any other keyring is locked or unlocked pass the
   name along:

   : keycheck ring_name
